The target of the following report of professional practices is to improve through reflection of my practices, the evaluation of the achievements levels acquired by the children of 2nd grade during my intervention in the “Efraín González Luna” kindergarten. Based on the investigation-action methodology with a qualitative approach, I've prepared an action plan that consist firstly to look for an issue on my actions, followed by the creation of three strategies: The creation of electronic portfolios, the automation of students answers, and the integration of parents in the evolutive development of their children.
During the process I made use of different instruments to evaluate the performance of the students such as rubrics, checklists or observation guides. Anecdotal and photographic records played a main role in the creation of electronic portfolios, while the usage of WhatsApp to create a virtual learning community and the implementation of a school diary, were the main tools to involve parents in the evaluation of children. At the end of the document, I evaluate the relevance of each one of my actions to conclude that the importance of looking for suitable tools according to the evaluative purpose and the triangulation of data to contrast and expand the collected data towards a fairer evaluation that considers all formative aspects.
