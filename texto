The school is immersed in a dynamic society that makes the teachers into agents of change, to be obligated to break the education paradigms that block them from acting according to their needs. The continuous improvement of this practice reigns, and with it, the self-reflective process becomes inherent.
The target of the following report of professional practices is to improve through the reflection on my practices, the evaluation of the achievement levels acquired by the children of the 2nd grade during my intervention in the “Efraín González Luna” kindergarten. Based on the investigation-action methodology using a qualitative approach, I have prepared an action plan that consists firstly to look for an issue within my actions, followed by the creation of three strategies: The creation of electronic portfolios, the automation of students answers, and the integration of parents in the evolutive development of their children.
During the process I used various instruments to evaluate the performance of the students including rubrics, checklists, or observation guides. Anecdotal and photographic records played a vital role in the creation of electronic portfolios, while the usage of the WhatsApp messaging platform to create a virtual learning community and subsequent implementation of a school diary were the main tools to involve parents in the evaluation of children. At the end of the document, I evaluate the relevance of each of my actions to conclude that the importance of looking for suitable tools according to the evaluative purpose and the triangulation of data to contrast and expand the collected data towards [towards = the UK, toward = the USA] a fairer evaluation that considers all formative aspects.
